        <h1>DREAM VACATIONS</h1>
        <h2>Vacations that NEED to happen</h2>
        
        <p>
            This is a collection of my dream vacation spots. Bora Bora is my #1 dream vacation ever since I was a little girl. Santorini is just so beautiful and I woud love to go here with my lover. Amsterdam is the dream spot for me and alongside some friends. Lastly, I've been wanting to go to Paris since I can remember.
